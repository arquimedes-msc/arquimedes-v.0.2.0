## 2024-08-05 - Enforced Secure JWT Secret Configuration
**Vulnerability:** The application's JWT secret (`JWT_SECRET`) defaulted to an empty string if not set in the environment variables. This critical vulnerability would allow an attacker to easily forge authentication tokens by signing them with an empty secret, granting unauthorized access to the application. Additionally, a weak, hardcoded secret was found in a deployment script.
**Learning:** The application was not designed to "fail securely." Instead of halting when a critical security component was misconfigured, it continued to operate in an insecure state. This highlights the importance of validating critical environment variables at startup.
**Prevention:** For all security-critical secrets (like JWT keys, API keys, etc.), implement a startup check in the application's entry point. This check should validate that the secret exists and meets minimum strength requirements (e.g., length). If the check fails, the application must throw a fatal error and refuse to start, preventing it from ever running in a vulnerable state.

## 2024-08-06 - Removed Hardcoded IP from Deployment Script
**Vulnerability:** A hardcoded IP address was found in the `deploy/deploy_hostinger.sh` script. This constitutes an information disclosure vulnerability, as it reveals specific infrastructure details that could help an attacker bypass protective layers like firewalls or CDNs and target the server directly.
**Learning:** Deployment and infrastructure-related scripts are a common source of hardcoded sensitive information and must be audited with the same rigor as application source code. Seemingly minor details like an IP address should be treated as sensitive and not be committed to version control.
**Prevention:** Standardize the use of placeholders and environment variables for all sensitive data within deployment scripts. Add a recurring task to security checklists to specifically audit non-application code (e.g., `.sh`, `.yml` files) for hardcoded secrets, keys, and infrastructure details.
